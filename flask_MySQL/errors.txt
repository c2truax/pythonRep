    return MySQLConnection(db)
NameError: name 'MySQLConnection' is not defined

FIX: Mistyped the name of my class so couldn't create an instance of an undefined class. Make sure class' name and when creating an instance from that class match.

Error: Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "server.py", line 9, in <module>
    print("all the users", mysql.query_db("SELECT * FROM users;"))
TypeError: query_db() missing 1 required positional argument: 'data'

FIX: I deleted the default value for the positional argument - "data", so it became a required argument that I had not provided. Had to add a default value for "data" of None so that it doesn't make it a required positional statement, instead if not provided it sets it to None.
